Introduction
=============
    This plugin is used for integrating SSO with JOSSO1.8.x in RubyOnRails 
    projects.
    If you developed some projects with JAVA, PHP, ROR... 
    However, some day you want to integrate all the projects with JOSSO, you will find that you can't get a absolute JOSSO agent for ROR. 
    Yes, You are right, this is my situation for developed a JOSSO agent for ROR projects called JOSSOAgentForROR. 
    Maybe I should make a good name, whatever.
    
    Your need and only need is use the "inject_josso_agent" method in the ApplicationController directly
    then copy josso_config.yml.template to josso_config.yml and modify the file in the directory 
    "Vendor/rorjossoagent/config".
    
    Please follow the Example.

Example
=======
    (1) create a Ruby On Rails application with NetBeans IDE and create a Controller such as TestController.
    (2) use the 'inject_josso_agent' method in the ApplicationController.
        class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
            # The ling below is you need to do.
            inject_josso_agent
            helper :all
            protect_from_forgery # :secret => '82080e75741b9780ebdb607d770322ae'
        end

    (3) Copy josso_config.yml.template to josso_config.yml. Modify the josso_config.yml file, 
        if you don't have josso you can deploy a josso application or use the default configuration 
        in josso_config.yml.
        # josso_root : JOSSO SSO gateway root url
        # josso_ws_root : Josso Web Services end point URL. In most cases same as josso_root.
        # partner_application_entry_url: JOSSO service provider URL
        
        development:
            josso_root: http://localhost:8080/sso-gateway/
            josso_ws_root: http://localhost:8080/sso-gateway/
            partner_application_entry_url: http://localhost:3000/main
        test:
            josso_root: http://localhost:8080/sso-gateway/
            josso_ws_root: http://localhost:8080/sso-gateway/
            partner_application_entry_url: http://localhost:3000/test
        production:
            josso_root: http://localhost:8080/sso-gateway/
            josso_ws_root: http://localhost:8080/sso-gateway/
            partner_application_entry_url: http://localhost:3000/test
    (4) Run the server by NetBean or command: ruby script/server
        And access the url 'partner_application_entry_url', you will see JOSSO login page,
        login with the username and password I told in the top words. OK, that's all.
